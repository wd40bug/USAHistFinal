      <h1>Pre-Revolution</h1>
      <p>
        Before the American Revolution, enslaved people were allowed the minimum freedom required to fulfill their crucial economic duties. In colonies like South Carolina, they even <a href="https://www.americanyawp.com/text/04-colonial-society/">made up most of the laboring population</a>. Most of these enslaved people were imported from Africa, although some of them would have been born in the colonies. The journey from Africa was cramped, dirty, and sickness spread easily. This shipment of slaves from Africa to America could take up to 6 months and <a href="https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=2&psid=446">only 60% of the slaves survived the journey</a>. Once in the colonies, these slaves would be sold as property. Crimes committed by enslaved people were heavily punished, but the colonists were allowed to brutalize their slaves almost without consequence. These terrible conditions would lead to periodic slave rebellions. These rebellions would focus on killing white masters, freeing additional slaves, and running for places like Florida, where escaped slaves who converted to Catholicism would be freed. In response to these rebellions, colonies would pass laws further restricting enslaved people’s freedom in the hopes of preventing future revolts.

      <h1>The Revolutionary War</h1>
      <p>
        The Revolutionary War held the promise of freedom to many enslaved people. For the British and the Revolutionaries, freedom for enslaved people was a practical and ideological tool they could use, not a moral necessity. The ideals expressed by the Revolutionaries, universal brotherhood and the equality of all men, spoke directly to the plight of the slaves. As such, many slaves fought for the Revolutionaries, some of which were awarded their freedom. However, the Revolutionaries did not provide a certain path towards freedom as the ideals of equality did not translate into actual anti-slavery policy. Fighting for the British provided a much more certain path towards freedom. <a href="https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-resources/spotlight-primary-source/lord-dunmores-proclamation-1775"> Early in the war the Governor of Virginia declared that any enslaved people who were willing to fight for the British would be freed</a>. This created a pathway to freedom that many enslaved people were quick to try and take advantage of. Over the course of the war nearly 100,000 enslaved people attempted to escape slavery by joining the British. Whether enslaved people tried to enlist with the Revolutionaries or the British it’s certain that the dream of freedom was foremost in their mind.

      <h1>The Early Republic</h1>
      <p>
        The early republic saw the formation of a government that failed to live up to its revolutionary ideals when it came to enslaved people and even increased repression in certain ways. During the war, the revolutionaries had championed their cause using virtues such as universal brotherhood and the equality of all mankind. Unfortunately for the enslaved former colony, these virtues were not used in ending slavery. While the constitution didn’t explicitly support the institution of slavery, in fact in never mentions slaves at all, it contains some protections for the institution including the three fifths compromise, fugitive slave clause, and importation of persons clause.However, the American Revolution wasn’t the only revolution during the end of the 18th century. Just a few hundred miles south of the new nation, the enslaved inhabitants of the island of Haiti led a successful revolution against their French masters. This revolt was a fright to the entirety of the enslaving world, as it proved African slaves could lead a successful revolution against their oppressors. To keep the Haitian revolution from repeating itself on American soil, harsh new laws were passed restricting the literacy and movement of enslaved Africans.

      <h1>Industrialization</h1>
      <p>
        During the period of Industrialization, enslaved people became crucial to the Southern economy, however their freedoms decreased due to a need to increase productivity. Before this period, enslaved people were mainly used for growing tobacco. <a href="https://www.americanyawp.com/text/11-the-cotton-revolution/">Growing tobacco was highly destructive for the soil and in the increasingly competitive South the margins from growing it began to decrease</a>. Many, including Thomas Jefferson, thought this would eventually end slavery as less enslaved labor would be needed as land was used up. Compounding this, the importation of new slaves was banned in 1800. However, two things changed the trajectory of this trend. Firstly, the Louisiana purchase opened new fertile lands for crop growing. Secondly, new strains of cotton and the invention of the cotton gin allowed southerners to switch to cotton, which was much gentler on the soil than tobacco. This switch to cotton increased demands on enslaved labor, which led to increasing violence against slaves to try and squeeze out more productivity. <br> Meanwhile, the American North began moving away from the institution of slavery, implementing policies of gradual emancipation where slaves would be free after a period of service. While this still priviledged certain white economic interests over the freedom of enslaved people, it was a sign that their right to freedom was beginning to be recognized.

      <h1>Antebellum</h1>
      <p>
        The Antebellum period was defined by an increasingly prominent abolitionist movement contrasted with an increasingly reactionary federal government controlled by slaver interests. Books critical of slavery, escaped slaves, religious revival and reaction to government interference combined to create increased abolitionist sentiment in the North. These abolitionists would form groups dedicated to the cause. These groups would then participate in moral instruction against slavery, political agitation, and directly freeing slaves, taking them to the North or Canada. However, this abolitionist movement was politically fractured, leaving the federal government dominated by Democrats, a pro-slavery party. This government instituted new programs to capture fugitive slaves, even programs that incentivized re-enslaving freed black people. Additionally, the Democrat-dominated supreme court handed down decisions that restricted the rights of slaves to sue in court and curtailed the ability of states to confiscate and free slaves. These government policies increased the ire of the Abolitionist movement and eventually led to the election of Abraham Lincoln, the first anti-slavery president.

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        The greatest obstacle to freedom for enslaved African Americans was agricultural interests in them as free labor as well as racist and practical fears of African-American violence. Agriculture in America was crucial to the economy, and a source of labor which didn't need to be paid was seen as crucial to its survival. Fears of African-American violence was due to both a prominent belief that the "African race" was unusually violent, but also because slavers understood that their slaves would, understandably, be willing to commit violence in service of freedom. The agricultural interests and the fears of violence contributed to the continuing and worsening system of slavery in the country, even despite movement toward freedom.
